# Personal Assistant
This application consist of several separate parts and helps me better organize my time, tasks, 
budget and interesting information.
First of all I wrote it to practice with Django framework.

**The application is run into docker container.**

Run in the terminal command: ``docker-compose up -d`` 
and open in browser http://0.0.0.0 (static files served by nginx, so use default port 80 or 8080)

**Or one of the aliases:**

`alias dd='docker-compose down`

`alias dl='docker-compose logs'`

`alias dr='docker-compose restart'`

`alias dsh='docker-compose exec python sh'`

`alias du='docker-compose up -d'`

`alias gpll='git pull'`

`alias gpsh='git push'`

`alias gs='git status'`
